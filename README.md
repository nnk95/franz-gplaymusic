Very basic Franz Recipe for Google Play Music

Google Play Music only works if you already have an account for it!
But just sign in to check anyway.

# Installation
Open the recipe folder of Franz

Can be found under

* Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Franz/recipes/`
* Windows: `%appdata%/Franz/recipes/`
* Linux: `~/.config/Franz/recipes/`

Create a `dev` folder.

Open it.

Create `gplaymusic` folder inside of the newly created `dev` folder.

Insert the files of the repository into the newly created `gplaymusic` folder.

The folder structure should look like this on a windows system:

```
C:\USERS\username\APPDATA\ROAMING\FRANZ\RECIPES
+---dev
|   \---instagram
|           icon.png
|           icon.svg
|           index.js
|           LICENSE
|           package.json
|           README.md
|           webview.js
```

Restart Franz, add Service, login, done!
